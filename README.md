# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module_7_SQL
## Overview of the analysis: 

- In the coming years, a number of team members are approaching retirement age. This could potentially create an issue for the success of the company if it is not able to find qualified talent and promotable talent to replace the critical knowledge. In order to prepare, this analysis provides the expected number of retiring employees per title and identify potential employees who can participate in a mentorship program to help develop future skillsets. 

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

- In the coming years, it is expected that over 90,000 employees could retire from the company. 
- Of those 90,000 employees, their titles are grouped into the below categories.
